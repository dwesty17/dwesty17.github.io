		<h1>Dylan Westerhold</h1>

		<p>
			I'm currently a full-stack software engineer working mostly on the guest-facing mobile app at Sonder in San Francisco. Before that, I worked at a cyber-security startup called Respond Software in Mountain View. And before that I worked at an even smaller startup called Right Call Consulting.
		</p>


		<p>
			I went to the University of Michigan where I played on the university's first division 1 lacrosse team. I was the first starting goalie in UM history. Go blue!
